### Sustainability and Ressource-saving
- **Zuerst kommentar Vorlesen**
	- Climate change and its consequences -> much more important -> need to have a look on sustainability
	- stragtegic meaning of sustainability is in close corralation to Companies
		- In survey -> 4.000 managerial staff answered -> 43% of Companys in the whole world -> have Chief sustainability Officer
			- That means, that for them, -> sustainability is now the center of their strategy
	- Now for the Quote: 
		- As implied ->digitization and sustainability go hand in hand
		- Energy- and resouceconsumption -> can be made much mor efficient during its entire Produkt-lifecycle -> through digitization of industrial Production and new value chains 
			- e.g. In Germany -> ca. 8% of Energy consumption can be reduces -> just an careful estimation
		- But through energy- and resourceefficiency alone -> goal of a sustainable economy cannot be reached
			- new businesses are important
			- and sustainability should either be:
				- the center 
				- a consequence 
			- of the Value creation structure
			- For that -> ten Theses -> give Companies a general direction -> how digital businesses can facilitate sustainability in Industry 4.0
			- **Die Grafik beschreiben, sagen, dass da die Thesesn jeweil eingeordnet sind**
				- *Value proposition (Werteversprechen)*
					- Is about how digital Technology helps companys operate more sustainable
					- 1. Theses -> Dematerialization through Digitalization
						- reduction of resource consumtion -> replacing physical products with digital products/technology
							- e.g. Paper -> Tablets ->reduction of tree cut downs
					- 2. Theses -> Sustainable Business Models
						- focus -> sustainability -> not mearly ressource efficiency
					- 3. Theses -> Information Capability
						- usage of data/transparency -> make sustainable business modells
					- 4. Theses -> Balance between Profit and Responsibility
						- balance between economic success and social responsibility
				- *Value creation offering (Wertschöpfungsangebote)*
					- How companies can create sustainable products and services
					- 5. Theses -> Service- and Usage-Based Business Models
						- from selling products -> to providing services
							- e.g. sharing economy
					- 6. Theses -> Digital Marketplaces
						- Platforms -> enable more efficient and sustainable transactions
				- *Value creation modell (Wertschöpfungsmodell)*
					- making the production process itself more sustainable
					- 7. Theses -> Quantification of Input and Output Values
						- Improved measurability of sustainability through data
					- 8. Theses -> Open Partnership Models
						- circular economic systems through partnership of companies
					- 9. Theses -> Managing the Rebound Effect
						- using innovation -> prevent the negative effect where more efficient technologies lead to increased consumption
				- *10. Theses -> political framework conditions*  
					- political support and regulation -> necessary to make the implementation of these concepts possible

### Current Trends
- Trends that are Present in 4.0 and will be present in 5.0 -> are a big part of the transition from 4.0 to 5.0
	- *Augmented Reality*
		- gets knowledge in such form, that people understand way more -> is easier to understand -> easier to use
			- is already existent in form of the metaverse or in gaming
			- is used as well in e.g. medical field -> use VR-goggles and hanptic gloves to practice an operation
	- *High-Speed-communication*
		- Connectivity needs to be adjusted -> to be able to manage the growing Datatraffic
		- 5G is big Part of the developement of IoT in a few Years
			- faster Networkspeed , less latency, optimised provision
				- more devices can be connected simultaniously 
					- network slicing (devide a single network into "slices") and less energy consumption
	- *easier Programming*
		- Skills are currently evolving.
		- Older professionals are leaving the industry, taking their expertise with them.
		    - This necessitates simplifying processes to give the new generation a fair chance
			    - In the past, developing an automation routine with ladder logic used to take weeks.
		        - Today, it’s a matter of minutes (using drag-and-drop configuration).
	- *AI*
		- Used, for example, for data collection and analysis as well as predictive maintenance.
		- Can also be used to train new employees.
			- Enables greater autonomy in production facilities.
	- *integration of OT and IT data*
		- *OT = Operational Technology*
		- *IT = Information Technology*
		- Speed is considered the most significant change.
		- Transition towards *Industry 5.0* is underway.
		    - *Industry 4.0:* Focuses on deriving value from industrial applications.
		    - *Industry 5.0:* Reinvests the benefits of Industry 4.0 with additional returns
